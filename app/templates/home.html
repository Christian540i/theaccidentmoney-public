                <h2>Why You Need a Lawyer After a Car Accident</h2>
                <p>After a car accident, dealing with the aftermath can be overwhelming. Insurance companies may try to minimize your claim, medical bills can pile up, and figuring out who’s responsible isn’t always straightforward. That’s why having a skilled lawyer by your side is crucial.</p>
                <p>Without an experienced attorney, you could risk being undercompensated or taken advantage of by insurance companies that are focused on their bottom line. A lawyer knows the ins and outs of the legal system and will handle all the paperwork, negotiations, and legal complexities on your behalf.</p>
